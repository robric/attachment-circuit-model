--- abstract

The document specifies a common Attachment Circuits (ACs) YANG module, which is designed with the intent to be reusable by other models. For example, this common model can be reused by service models to expose ACs as a service, service models that require binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device models to provision ACs, etc.

# Introduction

Connectivity services are provided by networks to customers via dedicated terminating points (e.g., service functions, customer edges (CEs), Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs), data centers gateways, Internet Exchange Points). A connectivity service is basically about ensuring data transfer received from (or destined to) a given terminating point to (or from) other terminating points that belong to the same customer/service, an interconnection node, or an ancillary node. A set of objectives for the connectivity service may eventually be negotiated and agreed upon between a customer a network provider. For that data transfer to take place within the provider network, it is assumed that adequate setup is provisioned over the links that connect customer terminating points and a provider network so that data can be successfully exchanged over these links. The required setup is referred to in this document as Attachment Circuits (ACs), while the underlying link is referred to as "bearers".

This document adheres to the definition of an Attachment Circuit as provided in Section 1.2 of {{?RFC4364}}, especially:

> Routers can be attached to each other, or to end systems, in a
   variety of different ways: PPP connections, ATM Virtual Circuits
   (VCs), Frame Relay VCs, ethernet interfaces, Virtual Local Area
   Networks (VLANs) on ethernet interfaces, GRE tunnels, Layer 2
   Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tunnels, IPsec tunnels, etc.  We will use
   the term "attachment circuit" to refer generally to some such means
   of attaching to a router.  An attachment circuit may be the sort of
   connection that is usually thought of as a "data link", or it may be
   a tunnel of some sort; what matters is that it be possible for two
   devices to be network layer peers over the attachment circuit.

When a customer requests a new value-added service, the service can be bound to existing attachment circuits or trigger the instantiation of new attachment circuits. Whether these AC are specific to a given service or be used to deliver a variety of services is deployment specific.

An example of ACs is depicted in {{uc}}. A Customer Terminating Point (CTP) may be a physical node or a logical entity. A CTP is seen by the network as a peer Service Attachment Point (SAP) {{?I-D.ietf-opsawg-sap}}. CTPs may be dedicated to one single service (e.g., Layer 3 VPN, Layer 2 VPN) or host multiple services (e.g., service functions {{?RFC7665}}). A single AC (as seen by a network provider) may be bound to one or multiple peer SAPs (e.g., CTP#1 and CTP#2). For example, and as discussed in {{?RFC4364}}, multiple CTPs (CEs) can be attached to a PE over the same attachment circuit. This is typically implemented if the layer 2 infrastructure between the CTP and the network provides a multipoint service. The same CTP may terminate multiple ACs. These ACes may be over the same or distinct bearers.

This document specifies a common module ("ietf-ac-common") for ACS. The model is designed with the intent to be reusable by other models and, therefore, ensure consistent AC structures among modules that manipulate ACs. For example, the common model can be reused by service models to expose AC as a service (e.g., {{?I-D.boro-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit}}), service models that require binding a service to a set of ACs (e.g., {{?I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang}})), network models to provision ACs (e.g., {{?I-D.boro-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit}}), device models, etc.

The common AC module eases data inheritance between modules (e.g., from service to network models as per {{?RFC8969}}).

The YANG data models in this document conform to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in {{!RFC8342}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in {{?RFC8340}}.

This document uses the following terms:

Bearer:
: A physical or logical link that connects a customer node (or site) to a provider network. A bearer can be a wireless or wired link. One or multiple technologies can be used to build a bearer. The bearer type can be specified by a customer.
: The operator allocates a unique bearer reference to identify a bearer within its network (e.g., customer line identifier). Such a reference can be retrieved by a customer and used in subsequent service placement requests to unambiguously identify where a service is to be bound.
: The concept of bearer can be generalized to refer to the required underlying connection for the provisioning of an attachment circuit. One or multiple attachment circuits may be hosted over the same bearer (e.g., multiple VLANs on the same bearer that is provided by a physical link).

Network controller:
: Denotes a functional entity responsible for the management of the service provider network.

Service orchestrator:
: Refers to a functional entity that interacts with the customer of a network service. The service orchestrator is typically responsible for the attachment circuits, the Provider Edge (PE) selection, and requesting the activation of the requested service to a network controller.

Service provider network:
: A network that is able to provide network services (e.g., Layer 3 VPN, Layer 2 VPN, and Network Slice Services).

Service provider:
: A service provider that offers network services (e.g., Layer 3 VPN, Layer 2 VPN, and Network Slice Services).

# Description of the AC Common YANG Module

The full tree of the "ietf-ac-common" module is shown in {{sec-full-tree}}.

## Identities

The module defines a set of identities, including the following:

'address-allocation-type':
: Used to specify the IP address allocation type in an AC. For example, this identity can used to indicate whether the provider network provides DHCP service, DHCP relay, or static addressing. Note that for the IPv6 case, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) {{?RFC4862}} can be used.

'local-defined-next-hop':
: Used to specify next hop actions. For example, this identity can be used to indicate an action to discard traffic for a given destination or treat traffic towards addresses within the specified next-hop prefix as though they are connected to a local link.

'l2-tunnel-type':
: Uses to control the Layer 2 tunnel selection for an AC. The current version supports indicating pseudowire, Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), and Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN).

'precedence-type':
: Used to indicate the redundancy type when requesting ACs. For example, this identity can be used to tag primary and secondary ACs.

## Reusable Groupings

The module also defines a set of reusable groupings, including the following:

'op-instructions' ({{op-full-tree}}):
: Defines a set of parameters to specify scheduling instructions and report related events for a service request (e.g., AC or bearer).

{: #op-full-tree title="Operational Instructions Grouping" artwork-align="center"}

Layer 2 encapsulations ({{l2-full-tree}}):
: Groupings for the following encapsulation schemes are supported: dot1Q, QinQ, and priority-tagged.

Layer 2 tunnel services  ({{l2-full-tree}}):
:  These grouping are used to define layer 2 tunnel services that may be needed for the activation of an AC. Examples of supported Layer 2 servers are the pseudowire
   (Section 6.1 of {{!RFC8077}}),  a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), or a Virtual eXtensible Local Area Networks (VXLANs) {{!RFC7348}}.

{: #l2-full-tree title="Layer 2 Connection Groupings" artwork-align="center"}

Layer 3 address allocation ({{l3-full-tree}}):
: Defines both IPv4 and IPv6 groupings to specify IP address allocation over an AC. Both dynamic and static address schemes are supported.

IP connections ({{l3-full-tree}})::
: Defines IPv4 and IPv6 grouping for managing layer 3 connectivity over an AC. Both basic and more elaborated IP connection groupings are supported.

{: #l3-full-tree title="Layer 3 Connection Groupings" artwork-align="center"}

Routing parameters ({{rtg-full-tree}}):
: In addition to static routing, the module supports the following routing protocols: BGP {{!RFC4271}}, OSPF {{!RFC4577}} or {{!RFC6565}}, IS-IS {{ISO10589}}{{!RFC1195}}{{!RFC5308}}, and RIP {{!RFC2453}}. For all supported routing protocols, 'address-family' indicates whether IPv4, IPv6, or both address families are to be activated. For example, this parameter is used to determine whether RIPv2 {{!RFC2453}}, RIP Next Generation (RIPng), or both are to be enabled {{!RFC2080}}. More details about supported routing groupings are provided hereafter:

  * Authentication: These groupings include the required information to manage the authentication of OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, and RIP. Similar to {{?RFC9182}}, this version of the common AC model assumes that parameters specific to the TCP-AO are preconfigured as part of the key chain that is referenced in the model. No assumption is made about how such a key chain is preconfigured. However, the structure of the key chain should cover data nodes beyond those in {{!RFC8177}}, mainly SendID and RecvID (Section 3.1 of {{!RFC5925}}).

  * BGP peer groups: Includes a set of parameters to identify a BGP peer group. Such a group can be defined by providing a local AS Number (ASN), a customer's ASN, and the address families to be activated for this group. BGP peer groups can be identified by a name.
  * Basic parameters: These groupings include the minimal set of routing configuration that is required for the activation of OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, and RIP.
  * Static routing: Parameters to configure an entry of a list of IP static routing entries.

# Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF {{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   {{!RFC8446}}.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}}
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The "ietf-ac-common" module defines a set of identities, types, and
   groupings.  These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
   modules.  The module by itself does not expose any data nodes that
   are writable, data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.

   YANG modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
   example, reusing some of these groupings will expose privacy-related
   information (e.g., 'ipv6-lan-prefixes' or 'ipv4-lan-prefixes').  Disclosing such information may
   be considered a violation of the customer-provider trust
   relationship.

   Several groupings ('bgp-authentication', 'ospf-authentication', 'isis-authentication', and 'rip-authentication') rely
   upon {{!RFC8177}} for authentication purposes.  As such, modules that will reuse these groupings
   will inherit the security considerations discussed in Section 5 of
   {{!RFC8177}}.  Also, these groupings support supplying explicit keys as
   strings in ASCII format.  The use of keys in hexadecimal string
   format would afford greater key entropy with the same number of key-
   string octets.  However, such a format is not included in this
   version of the common AC model, because it is not supported by the underlying
   device modules (e.g., {{?RFC8695}}).
