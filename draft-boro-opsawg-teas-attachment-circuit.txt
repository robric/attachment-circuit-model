1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a service YANG data model for attachment
   circuits.  The model can be used for the provisioning attachment
   circuits prior or during service provisioning (e.g., Network Slice
   Service).

   TBC

   An AC can be bound to a single or multiple SAPs
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-sap].

   The YANG data model in this document conform to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   This document uses the following terms:

   Network controller:  Denotes a functional entity responsible for the
      management of the service provider network.

   Service orchestrator:  Refers to a functional entity that interacts
      with the customer of a network service.  The service orchestrator
      is typically responsible for the attachment circuits, the Provider
      Edge (PE) selection, and requesting the activation of the
      requested service to a network controller.

   Service provider network:  A network that is able to provide network
      services (e.g., Network Slice Services).

   Service provider:  A service provider that offers network services
      (e.g., Network Slice Services).

4.  Sample Uses of the Attachment Circuit Data Models

4.1.  Separate AC Provisioning vs. Actual Service Provisioning

   The procedure to provision a service in a service provider network
   may depend on the practices adopted by a service provider, including
   the flow put in place for the provisioning of advanced network
   services and how they are bound to an attachment circuit.  For
   example, the same attachment circuit may be used to host multiple
   services.  In order to avoid service interference and redundant
   information in various locations, a service provider may expose an
   interface to manage ACs network-wide.  Customers can the request a
   base attachment circuit to be put in place, and then refer to that
   base AC when requesting services that are bound to that AC.

6.  YANG Module

   This module uses types defined in XXX.

   <CODE BEGINS> file "ietf-ac-svc@2022-11-30.yang"
   module ietf-ac-svc {

   INSERT HER
   }
   <CODE ENDS>

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the "ietf-ac-svc" module:

   *  TBC

   *  TBC

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability in the "ietf-ac-svc"
   module:

   *  TBC

   *  TBC

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ac-svc
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry.

      Name:  ietf-ac-svc
      Maintained by IANA?  N
      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ac-svc
      Prefix:  ac
      Reference:  RFC xxxx
